# Cinema Management System
The app I developed is a cinema management system for cinema managers. The movie in this system include the name, star-rating and type of moives, and managers can CRUD movie items. The system is developed based on the Flask-MongoDB Web App(https://github.com/dbdesign-students-fall2022/flask-mongodb-web-app). The app is rendered by Bootstrap(https://getbootstrap.com/).
